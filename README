DESCRIPTION
    hurdat.py 
    W. Cannon Matthews III - 01/27/13 
    
    A library to parse the HURDAT storm data provided by the NOAA
    into a easy to use python Object

CLASSES
    DailyData
    QuarterlyRecord
    Storm
    
    class DailyData
     |  Class to hold each daily record, contains 4 QuarterlyRecords in the quartersDict
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, date, quarters)
    
    class QuarterlyRecord
     |  class to hold each of the 4 readings per day
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, stage, lat, long, wind, press)
    
    class Storm
     |  Represents a storm, has a list of DailyData, and all the whole storm attributes
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, date, days, s_number, total_num, name, us_hit, hit_cat)
     |  
     |  saffir_simpson_days(self)
     |      Multiply the SSS Catagory times the length of time it spent there, then add it up for 
     |      a somewhat silly heuristic data analysis.

FUNCTIONS
    knots_to_mph(knots)
        given speed in knots, return float in mph
    
    mph_to_sscat(mph)
        given wind speed in mph, return the Saffir-Simpson-Scale Catagory [1-5], 0 for tropical storms
    
    parse()
        this fucntion parses the file, returns a list of all the storms
        parses every field in the data file
        assumes file in current directory called 'hurdat.txt' exists and is NOAA's HURDAT format 
        like: http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/hurdat/hurdat_atlantic_1851-2011.txt
        see also for explaination of format : http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/data_sub/hurdat.html
